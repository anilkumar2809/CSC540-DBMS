WolfWR Management System--> For WolfCity Whole-Sale Store Chain
Description:The project revolves around developing a database system for a wholesale-store chain, WolfWR, where the database will handle all the store operations related to club members, products, suppliers, billing staff, customers, etc. We are going to build a wholesale store chain which includes the functionalities like, system administration and staff management. This store chain is similar to that of large membership department stores in North America. There are many hierarchies in this project and each entity is interconnected with each other in an organized manner. With regard to the administrator, they will have all the data pertaining to customers, store information, transactions, rewards, etc. 
Also, there are four major tasks that will need to be performed: information processing, maintaining inventory records, maintaining billing and transaction records, and generating reports pertaining to a certain time period. Various tasks such as managing promotion or sale information for products can be done with these operations. We can also generate rewards for regular customers at the end of the year. Also, through billing transactions, we can generate bills that are to be paid to a supplier.
